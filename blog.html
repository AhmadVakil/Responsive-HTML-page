                                                <h3>What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h3>
                                                
                                                <section id="answers"> 
                                                                <p>
                                                                Well, basically to be able to communicate with web crawlers or web robots in other 
                                                                websites and to categorizing the website materials for accessing we should include 
                                                                robots.txt in our websites. We can use this text file to allow a material or to disallow it.
                                                                A web crawler uses automated algorithms to browse the websites on the world wide web and it 
                                                                also refers to our robots.txt. </p>
                                                                <p>As an example, I don't want to allow the Googlebot to view my images, so I have to indicate it in robots.txt like:<br>
                                                                
                                                                User-agent: Googlebot<br>     
                                                                Disallow: /images/</p>
                                                                
                                                                Some security uses of robots.txt such as indicating our private materials make it easier for Malicious bots to 
                                                                know where our secrets are located! Well, we should never use the robots.txt file as our main security while the 
                                                                vulnerabilities are exactly written in there.<br>

                                                                <p>The robots.txt file should be at the top level directory of our web server.
                                                                The robot will start looking in our root directory and will add the "robots.txt" in any directory that we have to find it.</p>
                                                                <p>I have decided to add my robots.txt file in the same directory which includes my index.html.
                                                                We should use all lower cases for the file name.<br>
                                                                In the example above I have disallowed Googlebot to view my images, this can be also changed to "*". If we use "*" instead of robot name, it will mean all the robots! And if we use "/" instead of a directory name, the meaning will be all the directories and subdirectories.</p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>So for example, I want to disallow all web robots and restrict their access from everything:<br>
                                                                User-agent: *<br>
                                                                Disallow: /</p>

                                                                <p>
                                                                Some tips:<br>
                                                                We should always remember to do not use "Dissallow" to address multiple directories. Each directory needs one disallow. <br>
                                                                We can only use a line break in the file only if we want to write another User Agent. Don't use line break between Disallows!
                                                                </p>

                                                        I have created a humans.txt file for this website and can be found in the main root of this website directory.
                                                        So, I will explain how it works:</p>
                                                        We need to create a simple text file and save it in the root folder, then the file should be filled up with below instructions.

                                                                So, We need to share our website contents with specified details (Images, titles, URL, etc.) and we need to specify this feature in the code with meta tags.</p>

                                                                 It's very important and we should know on which social network are we going to share our contents. meta tags are used to describe the URL, images, types, titles, and many more. Each pages of this website has it's own informations and description which are specified by meta tags.
                                                         </p>

                                                        <h3>Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?</h3>
                                                        <section id="answers">
                                                                <p>
                                                                        By separating CSS from HTML we can design one time but we get many results. A more clear explain, imagine we have a website with 20 pages and each pages contains too much information or even sensitive information, so how can we change the design in all pages?
                                                                        Changing all HTML files needs too much effort and we should look for each style to change and we might forget to change some parts natuarlly.
